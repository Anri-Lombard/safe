## Overview of SAFE

SAFE is a 

### Installation

You can install `safe` using pip.

```bash
pip install safe-smiles
```

Alternatively clone this repo, install the dependencies, install `safe` locally and you are good to go:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/maclandrol/safe.git
cd safe
mamba env create -f env.yml -n "safe-space" # :)
pip install -e .
```

`safe` mostly depends on [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index). Please see the [env.yml](./env.yml) file for a complete list of dependencies.


### Datasets and Models

We provided a pretained GPT2 model (50M parameters) using the SAFE molecular representation that has been trained on 1.1 billion molecules from Unichem (0.1B) + Zinc (1B): 

- *Safe-1.1B-dataset* [maclandrol/safe-50M]()
- *Safe-50M* [maclandrol/safe-50M]()


### Usage
